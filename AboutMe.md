# VASAVI DEVINENI
This is Vasavi Devineni. I have completed my bachelors in 2019 and then worked for 3 years in an MNC, John Deere. I love coding and learning different languages and tools which makes me think creatively. I am an ambitious and hardworking person who likes to challenge my analytical and logical thinking. Apart from this, I love to watch movies listen songs, spending time with family and friends in my leisure time which makes me feel refreshed.
