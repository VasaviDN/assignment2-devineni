###### Favorite Museum - Louvre Museum :

The Louvre's most famous work is Leonardo da Vinci's "**Mona Lisa**," who enchants hordes of visitors with her enigmatic smile. This small, iconic painting â€” it is only 21 by 30 inches (53 by 77 centimeters) is covered with bullet-proof glass and flanked by guards, according to the Louvre website. This protection is the result of it being stolen in 1911. (It was recovered in 1913.)

Crowds also flock to see the armless beauty of the "**Venus de Milo**," and "**Winged Victory**," the ancient Greek sculpture also known as "**Nike of Samothrace**." Other popular works include a stele inscribed with the Code of Hammurabi, da Vinci's tragic sculpture "**The Dying Slave**" and Antonio Canova's 18th-century sculpture "**Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss**." **Eugene Delacroix's** "**Liberty Leading the People**," which depicts the bare-breasted Liberty goddess leading a charge in the French Revolution, and is thought to have inspired Victor Hugo's "**Les Miserables**," and Jacques-Louis David's "**The Coronation of Napoleon**" was commissioned by Napoleon himself and is a good reminder of the Louvre's history.
